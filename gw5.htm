<h1 style="color:yellow;">Ocean currents</h1>
<p> The currents in the world's oceans are a result of varying temperatures associated with the changing latitudes of our planet. As the atmosphere is warmed nearest the equator, the hot air at the surface of our planet is heated, causing it to rise and draw in cooler air to take its place, creating what is known as circulation cells.
This ultimately causes the air to be significantly colder near the poles than at the equator.</p>
