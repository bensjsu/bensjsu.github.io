<h1>Sea Levels and Coastlines</h1>
<p>The consensus of many studies of coastal tide gauge records is that during the past century
sea level has risen worldwide at an average rate of 1–2 mm/yr reflecting a net flux of heat into the 
surface of the land and oceans. Corresponding studies based on satellite altimetry shows that this rate has 
increased to closer to 3 mm/yr during the more completely monitored past 20 years.A recent review of the literature
suggests that 30% of the sea level rise since 1993 is due to thermal expansion and 55% due to continental ice
 melt, both resulting from warming global temperatures. In another study, results estimate the heat content of the 
ocean in the upper 700 meters has increased significantly from 1955–2010. Observations of the changes in heat 
content of the ocean are important for providing realistic estimates of how the ocean is changing with global 
warming.</p>
