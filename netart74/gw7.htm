<h1 style="color:green;">Ocean Marine Life and Organisms</h1>
<p style="color:white;"> Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are 
taking a toll on the marine ecosystem. A study on phytoplankton changes in the Indian Ocean indicates a decline of up to 20% in marine phytoplankton during the past six decades.
Marine species affected by climate change include plankton - which forms the basis of marine food chains - corals, fish, polar bears, walruses, seals, sea lions, penguins, and seabirds.</p>

<p style="color:white;"> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts a further rise of between 1.4°C and 5.8°C by the end of the century. Climate change could therefore well be the knock-out punch for many species which are already under 
stress from overfishing and habitat loss.</p>
